# How to contribute to the project?
First of all, all contributions are welcome, whether they are typo fixings, bug squishing or introducing new features. Also creating new **issues** is good way to contribute to the project if you don't know how to program or don't know what to program.

## Branch to use
All pull requests should be directed to `dev` branch, as `main` is meant for production.

## Using conventional commits and gitmoji
All commits should use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and also [gitmojis](https://gitmoji.dev). Check the links to find out more.

### Conventional commits
Here are few simple CCs you should remember when doing your commits:

- `feat:`
    - You are introducing new feature/addition to the project.
- `refactor:`
    - You are editing/removing something from the project but not introducing any new features along the way.
- `fix:`
    - Pretty self-explanatory, you are fixing something.

Here is an example commit:
```
âœ¨ feat: Adding new login method
```

Other commit messages you can find from above link.

## Always test, test and test!
Test on your own development environment that the feature works before making a pull request. That should also be self-explanatory.
